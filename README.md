### **Introduction**

"Staking Rewards are the rewards that liquidity providers get when they
provide Liquidity to an incentivised pool and then stake this liquidity
position for a reward."

If you understand the above statement well, you can jump right on to
"Using InstaDapp's UI for Staking." But If you don't, you need not worry
because, at InstaDapp, we are motivated to help you make better use of
your assets by sharing the knowledge we have gathered for you.

To learn how to earn rewards by staking your liquidity position on the
Instadapp platform, we first need to understand what staking is. To
understand staking, we need to understand the concept of Liquidity Pool,
Liquidity Providers, and Liquidity.

### **Learning the concepts**

This blog section will help you build a basic understanding of Liquidity
Pool, Liquidity Providers, and Staking rewards. You can jump right onto
the guide if you are familiar with all this.

#### **Liquidity Pool and Liquidity Providers**

Imagine a case scenario where we do not have a concept of Currency. You
have 10 apples, and I have 10 Oranges, and I want to get apples in
exchange for oranges. If you are willing to make the trade, it\'s well
and good; we can agree and make the trade, but what if you don\'t want
to?

In that case, I would have to wait for someone else who has apples to
make a trade for my oranges; this process is inefficient for apparent
reasons. As we know, there is opportunity in every problem, so let\'s
solve that problem now:

Suppose you fill a basket with 5 apples and 5 oranges now; if my good
friend "Tim" wants to exchange oranges for apples, Tim will put his
oranges in the pool and take away apples, and you will get some fee for
providing this convenience. This is the basic concept behind a Liquidity
pool. A pool of liquidity where multiple participants can exchange and
provide into at will.

The person who created this apple-orange liquidity pool is called the
**Liquidity Provider,** and the basket is the **Liquidity Pool**.
Suppose I want to reap the benefits of this solution, then I can also
deposit apples and oranges in equal amounts to that pool.

Let's say I also decide to add 5 apples and 5 oranges to the existing
liquidity pool, now the pool has 10 apples and 10 oranges comprising
both of our liquidity. Now when my neighbor "Jane" uses this pool to
swap one fruit for another. Jane will have to pay a fee for using the
pool; that fee will then be equally distributed between you and me
(because we both provided the same amount of liquidity) as we both have
provided the service. In this example we were Liquidity Providers and
earned fees for providing Liquidity.

#### **Rewards Staking**

Now our market is full of apples and oranges (good if you are health
conscious ðŸ˜†), Now a chef "Tim" comes with a new type of food, let\'s
say Burger and wants to promote this in the market and wants it to have
a better value in the market. But why would anyone trade in exchange for
a burger if they are unsure about how the product is?

What if the chef "Tim" creates a good amount of liquidity pool? It may
then appeal to people that the burger holds good value, and then the
burger will be more known among the people.

This is when staking comes into play. The chef "Tim" will roll out an
offer that if someone provides liquidity to "Tim's" Burger-Apple pool
from today 11:59 P.M. to tomorrow 11:59 P.M., will be rewarded with some
oranges for the amount of time the liquidity is provided in the
Burger-Apple pool. So the chef "Tim" is giving some incentives and
rewards to the liquidity providers believing that it will help increase
the reach of burgers so that they will have a better value in the
future.

Instadapp provides users with the best and most robust UI to supply
their assets in the world's leading DEX, Uniswap. Using Instadapp users
can create and join Uniswap v3 Liquidity pools and even **create their
own staking rewards for liquidity providers** or **provide Liquidity and
Stake to earn rewards** using the Uniswap V3 protocol.

The terms "create their own staking rewards for liquidity providers" and
"provide Liquidity and Stake to earn rewards" must be understood
carefully.

1.  *Create their own staking rewards for liquidity providers*â€Š---â€Š
    Anyone can create a Uniswap v3 pool and incentivize it so that
    liquidity providers put their assets in it and get some rewards.
    This is similar to what our Burger Chef is making.

2.  *Provide Liquidity and Stake to earn rewards* ---In this process,
    our liquidity providers are staking their liquidity and getting
    rewards for contributing to the Staked pool.

### **Using InstaDapp's UI for Staking**

This blog section will help you learn how to use InstaDapp UI to gain
staking rewards.

Note -: This tutorial is performed on Polygon Mainnet.

Pre-requisite:- Metamask connectivity knowledge and some asset in
Metamask, for example, Matic. We will work with a minimal amount so that
you can follow along.

This Part of Blog Contains 7 Modules-

-   Connecting to Metamask and migrating to preferred chain

-   Creating DSA account on InstaDapp

-   Deposit Money in our DSA account to use on other protocols

-   How to trade one asset for another asset

-   Moving to Uniswap V3

-   How to create Uniswap Staking rewards

-   How to stake on staking rewards

> Noteâ€Š---â€ŠYou can skip to the fifth Module if you are familiar with the
> DSA account.

#### **Module 1â€Š---â€ŠConnecting to Metamask and migrating to preferred chain**

In this, we will learn to migrate from one chain to another, for
example, Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon, and connect to it using Metamask
Wallet.

**Step 1**â€Š---â€ŠMove to
[[www.defi.instadapp.io]{.underline}](https://defi.instadapp.io/), you
will see something like

![](media/image2.png){width="6.5in" height="3.0694444444444446in"}

**Step 2â€Š**---â€ŠChange the Mainnet in Top-Right to Polygon, click
connect, choose your preferred wallet, and connect it.

![](media/image3.png){width="6.5in" height="3.2083333333333335in"}

#### **Module 2â€Š---â€ŠCreating DSA Account**

The first time you use Instadapp. Instadapp will ask you to create a
DeFi Smart Account or DSA. The DSA account is a smart wallet that we
will be using to interact with different protocols such as Uniswap V3 on
our Interface. This account is the main link between you and InstaDapp.

**Step 1â€Š**---â€ŠClick on Create Account on the bottom right.

![](media/image4.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1944444444444446in"}

**Step 2â€Š**---â€ŠApprove the transaction fee to create the account(This
fee goes to the chain you are using)

![](media/image5.png){width="6.5in" height="3.485125765529309in"}

**Step 3**â€Š---â€ŠWait for the transaction completion.

![](media/image6.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1982589676290463in"}

**Step 4**â€Š---â€ŠHere is your DSA account.

![](media/image7.png){width="6.5in" height="3.2604166666666665in"}

#### **Module 3--- Depositing money in our DSA account to use other protocols.**

We have created our DSA account, but it does not contain any assets, so
we will deposit some assets or tokens in our DSA from our Metamask. To
do that, follow along.

**Step 1**â€Š---â€ŠClick on Deposit under Balance

![](media/image8.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1944444444444446in"}

**Step 2** ---â€ŠSelect the asset you want to deposit

![](media/image9.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1666666666666665in"}

**Step 3**â€Š---â€ŠEnter the amount you want to Deposit in your DSA

![](media/image10.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1805555555555554in"}

**Step 4**---â€ŠConfirm the transaction (testing with less amount for
now)

![](media/image11.png){width="6.5in" height="3.4722222222222223in"}

**Step 5**---â€ŠCheck your balance.

![](media/image12.png){width="6.5in" height="3.2222222222222223in"}

#### **Module 4 --- Trading one asset for another asset.**

We will need two assets when creating staking rewards(to create an
incentivized Liquidity pool), and we just deposited one asset, and we
will need another one. So we can either deposit another asset or trade
the deposited asset for some other.

**Step 1**â€Š---â€Š Click on trade beside the token you want to trade for
another. For example, here we want to sell Matic for dai.

![](media/image13.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1944444444444446in"}

**Step 2**â€Š---â€ŠEnter the token amount you want to swap for another. Here
I have selected DAI; based on the amount of Matic you wish to trade, it
will show you the amount of DAI you will get.

![](media/image14.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1944444444444446in"}

**Step 3**â€Š---â€ŠConfirm the trade.

![](media/image15.png){width="6.5in" height="3.486111111111111in"}

**Step 4**â€Š---â€ŠCheck the balance of both your tokens.

![](media/image16.png){width="6.5in" height="3.2222222222222223in"}

#### **Module 5--- Moving to Uniswap V3**

Uniswap V3 is a well-known DEX and Automatic Market Maker platform we
will provide liquidity to a trading pair, and generate staking rewards.
So let's open the Uniswap V3 protocol to use it in our UI.

**Step 1**â€Š---â€ŠExpand Protocols

![](media/image17.png){width="6.5in" height="3.2083333333333335in"}

**Step 2**â€Š---â€ŠClick on Uniswap V3 to move to the protocol.

![](media/image18.png){width="6.5in" height="3.2083333333333335in"}

#### **Module 6--- How to create Uniswap staking rewards**

In this blog module, we will learn how to put rewards on the pools so
that the pool\'s liquidity providers can get reward tokens by keeping
their liquidity position staked. We will create a pool with DAI as the
reward for Liquidity providers.

![](media/image19.png){width="6.5625in" height="3.1979166666666665in"}

You can see the pools under the "Staking Reward Pools" section; These
pools are available for staking your liquidity position. If you provide
liquidity to USDC/ETH (2nd pool in the image) by submitting USDC and
ETH, you will get Matic tokens as a reward.\
\
Reward Percent Ranges\
Why sir is there a range? On Uniswap v3 only active liquidity earns
rewards, meaning you must be providing liquidity at the current market
price. The rewards range depending on how concentrated your position is
to the current market, oh and everyone else who's also staking for
rewards.\
\
\
This section will learn how to create a pool for yourself on InstaDapp's
UI.

**Step 1**---â€ŠClick on "+New Reward," you will get to

![](media/image20.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1666666666666665in"}

**Step 2**---â€ŠSelect the pair on which you want to give rewards. For
example, we want to reward people who provide liquidity to the MATIC/DAI
pool, and we select Matic and Dai in the "Select pair" section.

![](media/image21.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1805555555555554in"}

**Step 3**â€Š---â€ŠSelect the fee by clicking on any three fee tiers. We
have three options 0.05%, 0.3%, and 1%; keeping the fee as 0.3% means
that whenever someone swaps one token for other in the pool, the
liquidity providers will get 0.3% of the value swapped.

![](media/image22.png){width="6.5in" height="3.2083333333333335in"}

**Step 4**â€Š---â€ŠSelect the token you want to give as a reward; suppose
you want to give DAI as a reward to the liquidity providers. So select
DAI under the "Select Reward Token" and enter the amount you want to
give as a reward; for example, we will give 1 Dai to liquidity providers
as rewards.

![](media/image23.png){width="6.5in" height="3.2083333333333335in"}

**Step 5**â€Š---â€ŠSelect the time frame for which you want this offer to be
available for the liquidity providers, the creation date of this
tutorial is 17 Feb., lets put the start time as 17 Feb, 11:00 P.M. and
end time as 18 Feb, 11:00 P.M. that is for one day. That means that if
someone provides liquidity within that time frame is eligible to get
rewards until the reward time ends, that is 18 Feb at 11:00 P.M.

![](media/image24.png){width="6.5in" height="3.2083333333333335in"}

**Step 6**â€Š---â€ŠClick on Create Incentive and confirm payment on
Metamask.

![](media/image25.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1944444444444446in"}

**Step 7**---â€ŠCheck the "Staking Rewards Pools" list and mark the "Yet
to start" check box. After that, you would see all the Reward pools that
currently offer rewards and the reward pools that will start offering
rewards soon. In the list, you will also find the reward pool we
created.

![](media/image26.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1944444444444446in"}

#### **Module 7--- How to stake on staking rewards**

In this module, we will learn how to provide liquidity to an existing
pool to get rewards for it.

**Step 1**â€Š---â€Š Select the pool from the "Staking Rewards Pool" these
pools give an incentive to provide liquidity, so we can select any of
the pools we want to provide liquidity to and reap the benefits. For
example, let\'s choose USDC/ETH by clicking on it.

![](media/image27.png){width="6.5in" height="3.2083333333333335in"}

**Step 2**â€Š---â€Š Selecting a pool this way will automatically set the
price range so that you provide 50/50 liquidity, equal parts of two
assets. Uniswap v3 allows liquidity providers to create price ranges
where the liquidity may not be 50/50, you can even leave the range as it
is if you wish to.

![](media/image28.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1805555555555554in"}

**Step 3**â€Š---â€ŠEnter the amount you want to put in the liquidity pool,
but make sure you have both the assets in an equal amount. Suppose you
want to put USDC worth 3 \$ then you must also put 3 \$ worth of ETH.
The amount of the other asset will be automatically calculated when you
enter the deposit amount for one asset. (You can trade your available
asset to get these USDC and ETH assets, you can follow the fourth module
for that).

![](media/image29.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1666666666666665in"}

**Step 4**â€Š---â€Šclick on create and then confirm from your Metamask
wallet.

![](media/image30.png){width="6.5in" height="3.1944444444444446in"}

**Step 5**â€Š---â€ŠCheck your position under the "Your Position" section of
the webpage. Your position is now staked and earning rewards! Instadapp
will automatically stake your positions on all available rewards. You
came from WMATIC but you will also receive all ongoing staking rewards
being rewarded to USDC/ETH 0.03%.
